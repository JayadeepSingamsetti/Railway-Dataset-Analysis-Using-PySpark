## Dataset Description

The dataset contains 50 years (1964-2014) of Indian railway infrastructure data tracking:

- **Block Huts**: Signaling and traffic control structures
  - Broad Gauge, Metre Gauge, Narrow Gauge breakdowns
- **Halts**: Passenger service points
  - Categorized by gauge types
- **Key Metrics**: Total infrastructure counts and gauge-wise distributions
